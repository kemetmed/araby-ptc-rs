# 2. Use Rust for backend software development

Date: 2023-03-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a language to write the backend software in.

We expect our chosen language to be:

- Easy to learn
- Easy to maintain
- Fast to develop with / prove a concept
- Secure
- Reliable
- Performant
- Expected to remain a relevant language in the industry

## Decision

We will use Rust.

## Consequences

- New developers to the project have to learn Rust, however we believe it is a fantastic investment, akin to learning Kubernetes or SQL.
- Not going fullstack with Typescript means we do not get to leverage the tooling and ecosystem of Typescript technologies.
