# Observability

## Introduction

In the context of web APIs, Observability refers to the ability to gain insights into the performance and behavior of a system by collecting and analyzing data from its components. This includes metrics such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization, as well as logs, traces, and other telemetry data. Observability is essential for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of cloud-based systems, especially as they become more complex and distributed. By leveraging observability tools and techniques, developers and operators can quickly identify and diagnose issues, optimize performance, and improve the overall user experience. Ultimately, observability enables organizations to better understand and control their cloud environments, leading to improved business outcomes and customer satisfaction.

## Tracing

### Introduction to Tracing

Tracing is a technique used in software applications to track and log the flow of requests as they traverse through different components of the system. Implementing tracing in a software application is important because it provides visibility into the performance and behavior of the system. By logging the various stages of a request, tracing can help developers identify bottlenecks and errors in the system, as well as the root cause of these issues. Tracing can also be used to optimize the performance of the system by identifying areas where processing time can be reduced. Additionally, tracing can be used to improve the user experience by providing insights into user behavior and usage patterns. Overall, implementing tracing is essential for building scalable, reliable, and observable software systems, which are critical in today's world of complex, distributed systems.

### [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides a standardized way of instrumenting software applications to collect telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is a merger of two similar projects: OpenCensus and OpenTracing. OpenTelemetry provides a vendor-agnostic approach to instrumentation, allowing developers to instrument their applications once and then use any number of tracing, logging, or monitoring tools for analysis. OpenTelemetry supports most programming languages and platforms. It also supports various telemetry data types such as distributed traces, metrics, and logs, and provides a standardized way of propagating context across different components of the system. OpenTelemetry is rapidly gaining adoption as a standard for observability instrumentation in modern cloud-native applications.

## Monitoring

A /metrics endpoint is a URL endpoint that exposes operational metrics and monitoring data for a web application. It typically returns a standardized format of metrics data, such as in the form of JSON or plaintext.

The value of a /metrics endpoint for a web application is that it provides insights into the performance and health of the application. It allows developers, system administrators, and other stakeholders to monitor and track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the application's usage, behavior, and resource consumption.

Some examples of metrics that a /metrics endpoint might expose include:

- Request counts and response times: These metrics can provide insights into how many requests the application is handling, how quickly it is responding to them, and whether there are any issues with latency or performance.

- Error rates: This metric can help identify issues with the application, such as server errors, timeouts, or other problems that might be affecting the user experience.

- CPU and memory usage: These metrics can help identify whether the application is experiencing any resource constraints or performance issues that could affect its stability or reliability.

- Cache hit rates: This metric can provide insights into how often the application is able to serve requests from its cache, which can help identify potential opportunities for optimization or tuning.

Overall, a /metrics endpoint provides valuable insights into the inner workings of a web application, allowing developers and administrators to more effectively monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the application's performance and reliability. The /metrics endpoint exposed by Veloxide is scraped by the Prometheus supporting container.

## Logging

### Introduction to Logging

Logging is a technique used in software applications to record events that occur during the execution of a program. These events can include information such as errors, warnings, and other diagnostic data. Implementing logging in a software application is important because it provides visibility into the performance and behavior of the system. By logging events as they occur, developers can identify issues in the system, such as errors or performance bottlenecks, and then use this information to diagnose and resolve the issues. Logging can also be used to improve the user experience by providing insights into user behavior and usage patterns. Overall, implementing logging is essential for building scalable, reliable, and observable software systems, which are critical in today's world of complex, distributed systems.

### Bunyan

Bunyan is a logging library originally for Node.js applications. It was named after Paul Bunyan, the mythical lumberjack from American folklore, as a metaphor for cutting through the logs. Using Bunyan has several advantages:

1. Structured logging: Bunyan logs are JSON objects, making it easy to filter, analyze, and process the log data. This structured approach allows for better log management and analysis in comparison to unstructured text logs.
2. Third-party integrations: Bunyan integrates well with third-party log management and analysis tools, such as Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana or Grafana Loki. This allows you to leverage powerful log analysis and visualization tools to gain better insights into your application's performance and behavior.
2. Readable logs: Bunyan provides a command-line tool called 'bunyan' that can be used to pretty-print log output, making it more human-readable.

You will have the bunyan CLI tool installed if you have ran `just install-required` in the root of the project. The `bunyan` feature flag is enabled by default. If you want to test the locally, run the application and pipe the output into bunyan.
