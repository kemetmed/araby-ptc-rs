# Prometheus

## Introduction to Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that is widely used in the DevOps and cloud computing communities. The value of Prometheus lies in its ability to provide powerful and flexible monitoring capabilities for cloud-native applications, microservices architectures, and other distributed systems.

Some of the key benefits and value propositions of Prometheus are:

- Scalability: Prometheus is designed to handle large-scale, highly dynamic environments, with support for horizontally scaling across multiple instances and federating metrics across different systems and clusters.

- Time-series data: Prometheus is optimized for collecting and querying time-series data, which is critical for monitoring and troubleshooting modern distributed systems that generate vast amounts of metrics over time.

- Flexibility: Prometheus supports a wide range of metrics formats, including the popular Prometheus format and other industry-standard formats like OpenMetrics and Graphite.

- Query language: Prometheus comes with a powerful query language called PromQL, which allows users to slice and dice metrics data in real-time and build complex queries and aggregations.

- Alerting: Prometheus includes a built-in alerting system that allows users to define rules and conditions for triggering alerts based on specific metrics and thresholds.

- Integrations: Prometheus integrates with a wide range of other tools and systems, including Grafana for data visualization, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and many other popular DevOps tools.

Overall, the value of Prometheus lies in its ability to provide a flexible, scalable, and powerful monitoring and alerting solution that can help DevOps teams and other stakeholders to gain deep insights into the performance and health of their applications and infrastructure, enabling them to proactively identify and resolve issues before they become critical.

## Veloxide and Prometheus

Veloxide exposes a /metrics endpoint by default, which the Prometheus instance spun up by docker compose will scrape by default.
